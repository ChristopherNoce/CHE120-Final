This is the final project for the course CHE120 - Computer Literacy and Programming for Chemical Engineers. It was created by Kevin Yang, Kevin Huang, and Christopher Noce. We chose to recreate Pong using Pygame. We found source code for Pong online and added comments to the code. We then decided to modify the game, adding complexity.
